# MyMovieDatabase

This is my examination project, MyMovieDatabase. In this project, I will be utilizing my skills in HTML, CSS, and most importantly, JavaScript. I plan to incorporate functions, objects, error handling, modules, and APIs to create a dynamic and interactive webpage.

My main goal is to create a webpage that is accessible, responsive, and enjoyable for users.

Happy browsing!
